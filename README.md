Hi, my name is Donhem Brown. I graduated with a bachelor's degree from Johns Hopkins University in the biological sciences, and I now currently apply my mindset to a variety of technologies, such as Android Development, primarily utilizing the Kotlin Language. While I program in Kotlin currently, I am also well-versed in languages like Java, Javascript, and R. Overall, I am proficient on both the frontend and backend sides of development, and am very adept at thinking "outside" the box. I can communicate my ideas, regardless of how "niche" they appear, very clearly and effectively to demonstrate the potential to the relevant audience and requirement. I am happy to take a crack at any challenge that is lobbed in my direction!
